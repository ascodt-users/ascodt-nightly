!! Unit test component

This component holds a unit test environment and an XML configuration using the
component configuration.

!!! Usage

When a class X should be tested, a unit test class, e.g., named XTest has to be
created which is derived from TestCase. XTest implements the method run()
of TestCase to trigger the tests and uses the macro runMethod(testMethodName) in
method run() to call a test method implemented in XTest. This enables the correct
logging output during the test cases. In order to register XTest as unit test, the
macro registerTest(namespaceofxtest::XTest) has to be called in the .c/.cpp 
implementation of XTest. It is possible to distinguish unit and integration tests,
where the latter is recognized by using a different registration macro called
registerIntegrationTest(...).
